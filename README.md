## The Pivot

This is a project for the Turing School of Software and Design.

The goal is to take legacy code, namely a website that was previously a site
for a restaurant, and turn it into a multitenant site.

In particular, we are building Keevahh.

Keevahh

Micro-lending is a powerful tool for social progress. Let’s rework Dinner Dash into a micro-lending platform.

* Users register on the site as either a borrower (the business) or a lender
(the customer)
* Borrowers automatically have a borrower page (the store)
* Within that borrower page, they post one or more loan requests (the products)
* A loan request has a title, description, categories, photos, borrowing amount,
requested-by date, a repayments-begin date, and a repayment rate
* A lender can browse the site and view all open loan requests
* They can add multiple loans from multiple borrowers to their cart
* They can then checkout and the funds are allocated to the borrowers
* The borrowers are notified that funding has come through and their loan
request page is updated
* Lending like this is more fun together – it’d be great if lenders could band
together into lending groups that make loans together on a weekly or monthly basis.
